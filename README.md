## Software general decription
This software allows you to solve the Fenton-Karma (FK) model with a diffusive coupling in a 3D domain with a constant rotating conducting anisotropy. The software allows for input/output files and real time graphics for user interactivity. Additional features such as chirality selection, window snapshots, filament tracking, among others are available.


## Software requirements
- CUDA v7 or higher
- glew.h, glut.h, freeglut.h
- SOIL.h library (sudo apt-get install libsoil-dev)
